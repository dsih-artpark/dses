    This documentation is under active development and might be changing. Check out our Github to see the latest changes.

This is the documentation for the data standards for environmental surveillance, developed by the Data Science Innovation Hub at `ARTPARK <https://www.artpark.in/>`_ at the `Indian Institute of Science <https://iisc.ac.in>`_.

The aim is to create a set of data standards, along the lines of `FHIR HL7 <https://hl7.org/fhir/>`_ that are fast to adopt, interoperable, and can be scaled to any kind of disease while allowing extensibility for any user's specific use-case.

If you are currently on Github - you can find the docs hosted at `dses.dsih.artpark.in <https://dses.dsih.artpark.in>`_.
