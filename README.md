This is the documentation for the data standards for environmental surveillance, developed by the Data Science Innovation Hub at [ARTPARK](https://www.artpark.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in).

The aim is to create a set of data standards, along the lines of [`FHIR HL7`](https://hl7.org/fhir/) that are fast to adopt, interoperable, and can be scaled to any kind of disease while allowing extensibility for any user's specific use-case.
